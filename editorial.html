 <b> Dividends </b><br />

          <p>Dividends is the Saunders College of Business   alumni magazine at RIT. In the past, this publication was created and   distributed quarterly, but in the summer of 2009 a decision was made to   turn the magazine into a yearly publication with online updates. I was   chosen out of many potential students for this internship. After much   research into past editorials, I decided upon the sections and types of   stories that would be included into Dividends</p>
          <p>This led to me to speak with professors and alumni to   perform interviews for articles in the magazine. After assembling a   small team of four people to write articles and much editing we had   completed enough articles to fill a 24 page magazine. As the co-op and   only person dedicated to this project, much of the writing and   editing fell onto me.</p>
          <p>Following the completion of the written and edited   articles, I was faced with the task of designing the entire magazine. At     first this was a challenge because I had only dealt with Photoshop and   Illustrator in the past. After a week or so of learning InDesign and   creating layouts for the magazine, I settled upon a design for the   magazine. After many meetings with my supervisor and the dean of the   college, tweaks were made and the magazine was completed and ready for   printing.</p>
          <p>The printing process went through the university's printing press.   After a sample magazine was printed and some minor alterations were   made, the magazine   was approved to be printed. In all 500 copies of the magazine were   printed and distributed to alumni. </p>
