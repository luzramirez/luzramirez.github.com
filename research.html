 <b> Senior Thesis </b><br />

          <p>As a senior Advertising and Public Relations student I was required to complete a successful senior thesis in order to graduate. I chose to perform an experiment and survey on the determinants to online game player’s attitudes toward in-game advertisements.  I chose this subject because in-game advertisments have for the last few years been a big interest of mine. This is because it is an entire new world that many people don't know about and haven't yet explored. I see many big things in the future and I would love to be part of that movement.</p>

<b> Abstract </b><br />
          <p>Online video games have exponentially grown in popularity since their creation. Millions of Americans are spending the majority of their free time and money on online video games. For these reasons, advertisers have taken notice and are allocating large amounts of resources to in-game advertisements. The young age of the online gaming medium has created a lack of specific research for advertisers to use when planning media campaigns. </p>
          <p>This study aimed to examine and report the attitudes and experiences gamers have towards in-game advertisements through empirical methods. Experimentation provided several sets of significant data, centered around ad recall and gamer attitudes. The results of this study stand to improve gamers' experiences in online video games and advertisers' in-game marketing techniques to form a mutually beneficial relationship between consumers and advertisers.</p><br /><br /> </div>
